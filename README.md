# Snap
Snap Project for Blink

THE ASSIGNMENT

We would like you to write a command line app in Scala or Java. You are free to use just 
standard libraries, or any combination of others that will make the task easier for you, or 
cleaner. The problem is deliberately not too complex to focus on the things mentioned above.
The task is to simulate a game of snap between two players using standard playing card decks.
These requirements should drive your solution in a way that will show us multiple facets of your 
coding style:

• The application should ask the user how many playing card decks to play with (also 
possibly how many players, but can also default to just 2)
• The application should ask the user whether cards should be matched: on suit, value, or 
both
• The application should shuffle the decks before play commences
• Games of snap should then be simulated between players. Cards are played one at a 
time in order by each player in the game, onto their stack. When a player deals a card 
that matches a card at the top of another player's stack, the first player to 'shout' snap 
'takes' the two piles.
• The stop condition can be either after the first round when all cards were dealt, with the 
winner being the player who scored more cards, or after multiple rounds once one 
player holds all the cards. Whichever is easier / makes more sense to you. 
• You may choose single or multithreaded approach whichever suits you better, but do 
include some form of randomness
